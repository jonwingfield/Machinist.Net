Machinist.NET
============================================

Inspired by the awesome ruby testing tool that allows simple, yet powerful test data generation for tests.  As much as possible, it keeps a similar syntax to the Ruby tool while honoring C# conventions and idiosyncracies.

Stay tuned...

Dependencies
--------------------------------------------
Right now, Machinist.NET relies on Faker.NET and sugar.  I plan on removing these dependencies shortly and allowing for injection if necessary.
